# Bash in Batch

Windows doesn’t always give you the handy Linux-style commands you’re used to —
and that can be frustrating if you love working in the command line. **Bash in
Batch** is a simple solution to that problem: a set of `.bat` scripts that mimic
common Linux commands, making your Windows terminal experience a lot smoother.

## ⚡️ Features

- Enables common Linux-style commands on Windows.
- Straightforward batch script implementations.
- No special installations required — just add the directory to your `PATH`.
- Open to extensions and contributions.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1️⃣ Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone <repo-link>
```

### 2️⃣ Place It in a Desired Location

Move the cloned directory to any path where you’d like to keep these utilities.

### 3️⃣ Add It to Your System `PATH`

- Copy the path of the cloned directory.
- Open **Edit the System Environment Variables** > **Environment
    Variables...**
- Append the path to the `Path` variable.

### 4️⃣ Done

Open any new command prompt or terminal window, and you can now use your new
Linux-style commands.

## 🛠️ Available Commands

- `ls`: List files in the path mentioned.

    ```bash
    ls <path>
    ```

- `touch`: Create a new file.

    ```bash
    touch <filepath>
    ```

- `clear`: Clear the terminal screen.

    ```bash
    clear
    ```

## 💡 Why This Project?

Windows can be cumbersome when you're used to working with Linux-style
utilities. This project aims to bridge that gap, making it more comfortable for
developers who operate across both environments.
